Components of this repo:

./data/stressor exposure_telomeres.csv - main dataframe with meta-analysis data

./data/stressor exposure_telomeres_oxidative stress.csv - smaller set with oxidative stress data for the bivariate analysis

./data/metadata.txt - description of data fields

analysis_code.R - full script; NOTE - some sections are commented out as they take long time to run, more in comments

190807_final_selection.Rdata - for convenience, archived model selection obejct from MuMIn, just load instead of running full selection
